# get-data-from-figures

Workflow for using the R package metaDigitise to scrape raw data from figures

Using Figure 1A and Figure 5 from this paper as examples: https://academic.oup.com/jimb/article/50/1/kuad008/7120041

Step 1: Use powerpoint to crop and prepare figures and save each slide as a single png file – one figure panel per file (helps to change slides to square dimensions)
Make a slide for each panel data will need to be collected from.
Make figure as big as possible on each slide
It may also be helpful to add other information to slides so it’s easy to reference while collating data (eg author name, incubation temperature, sample size…)
Error bars should be oriented up/down, not left/right – rotate figure if needed.
Make sure axes are visible, crop and combine sections of the plot as needed so each panel has axes and labels
