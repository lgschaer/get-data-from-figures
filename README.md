# get-data-from-figures

Workflow for using the R package metaDigitise to scrape raw data from figures

Using Figure 1A and Figure 5 from this paper as examples: https://academic.oup.com/jimb/article/50/1/kuad008/7120041

Figure 1A:

Step 1: Use powerpoint to crop and prepare figures (it may help to change slide to square dimensions)
–Create one slide for each figure panel that data will be extracted from
-Make figure as big as possible on each slide
-It may also be helpful to add other information to slides so it’s easy to reference while collating data (eg author name, incubation temperature, sample size, etc …)
-Error bars should be oriented up/down, not left/right – rotate figure if needed.
-Make sure axes are visible, crop and combine sections of the plot as needed so each panel has axes and labels

Step 2: Extract data in R

Step 3:
